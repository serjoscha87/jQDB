<h1>jQDB - jQuery inline Database-Table Editor plugin</h1>

Well, massive headline. Now something about it.

<h3>Prolog</h3>
Well... My story begins with the search for a tool... something I need in a non-generic form again and again from time to time:
simple, direct and mostly unfiltered inline editing of (relational) Database-Table data within a Web-Page (formally in  Admin/Config Backends)

<h3>Purpose of this jQuery Plugin</h3>
This plugnin shall serve an - **easy to use** - way to create generic inline editing areas within any of your pages for data which is autoloaded from a relational Database-Table through a predefined connector. Currently there is only a mySQL connector but it shall be simple to add more connectors for postgresql or what ever needed.


<h3>compat</h3>
Tested in Chrome and Firefox
